# DXS

DXS is an open source hex swapper for Fortnite<br>
It was made by **Prototbh** and **appelmoesGG**

# Installation / usage:
1. Download DXS from [here](https://proto-proxy.github.io/proto-proxy-web/) or [here(latest version, used in tutorial)](https://github.com/appelmoesgg/DXS/releases/latest)(Download `Source Code (zip)`)
2. Unzip the file you downloaded
3. Run install.bat and then run dxs.pyw
4. Click **Upload .fswap** and select the fswap you would like to use (swaps available [here](https://discord.gg/vkw9wuuX5z))
5. Wait for it to load and your done!
> To remove swaps: verify your game files...<br>
> We are working on a reverse fswap file that removes your swap...

# Compile (compile-to-exe is experimental!):
I wrote compile-to-exe.bat on my phone so it is not verified to work!
In case the .pyw file is not working:
1. Make sure you already have ran the install.bat file!
2. Run compile-to-exe.bat
3. You will now find a .exe in the `dist` folder
4. Run that and DXS should run fine
